### **File Organizer Project - Brief Overview**

The **File Organizer** project is a Python script that organizes files in a directory by categorizing them into folders based on their file extensions. It simplifies managing cluttered directories like `Downloads`.

#### **How It Works**:
1. **File Scanning**: Scans the specified directory for files.
2. **Categorization**: Groups files into categories such as **Images**, **Documents**, **Videos**, **Audio**, or **Others** based on their extensions.
3. **Folder Creation**: Creates folders for each category if they donâ€™t exist.
4. **File Movement**: Moves each file to its respective folder.

#### **Example**:
If the directory contains:
```
photo.jpg, report.pdf, video.mp4, song.mp3
```

It organizes them as:
```
Images/photo.jpg, Documents/report.pdf, Videos/video.mp4, Audio/song.mp3
```

#### **Benefits**:
- Keeps directories organized.
- Saves time and effort.
- Customizable for different file types.
